# RAXY Input System

RAXY Input System provides a flexible touch gesture module and an event-driven workflow managed through the `Raiser` class.

It is designed to unify and streamline both touch and keyboard inputs, allowing you to switch or expand input methods without modifying your core gameplay logic.

This package uses the **[Joystick Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/joystick-pack-107631)** for virtual joystick support, and the asset is already included inside the package.

## Features
- Touch gesture recognition (tap, swipe, pinch)
- Centralized event-based input handling
- Easy expansion using the `Raiser` class
- Clean separation between input detection and gameplay logic
- Built-in virtual joystick support via Joystick Pack
